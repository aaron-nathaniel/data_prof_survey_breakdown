The project involved cleaning data in Excel and importing it to Power BI, creating various visualisations such as bar charts, treemaps, and gauges to display data, and formatting and organising the dashboard layout.

## Background:

The project was based on real data collected from an anonymous survey of data professionals. The data source was in a CSV file with multiple questions, including yearly salary, favourite programming language, difficulty of breaking into data, and country of origin, among others. The data was first cleaned in Excel, then in Power BI.
