You can access the interactive Power BI Dashboard [HERE](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNGFjYjdlZDItNzg2Yi00YjM4LTgwOTktNzVhYjMyOGI3ZjllIiwidCI6IjNkZTFmNGJmLTViZTUtNDQ4Zi1iZGJlLTg1NWYyNjc5MTlkMiIsImMiOjh9)

The report depicts quarterly, annual and overall dashboards of various training programmes. 

The project first started in Tableau as I was learning how to use it while doing Googleâ€™s Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Later on I wanted to replicate it in Power BI as I took interest in this platform as well. Any further improvements and additions were made in Power BI only as my Business Intelligence platform of choice.

## The dataset contains 3 tables in Excel:

**Attendance** contains: Course Category, Session Type, Course Start Date, Course End Date, Financial Quarter, No. of Sessions and No. of Attendees

**Eventbrite Data** contains: Event Name, Date Attending, Financial Quarter, Country of Residence, Profession

**Feedback Data** contains: Question, Quarter, Rating, No. of answers

## The most important KPIs to report were:

- the number of attendees of open-access, paid and volunteer courses
- the number of open-access, paid and talk/conference sessions
- the number of volunteer cohorts trained
- the geographic distribution of attendees
- top professions based on the % of the total attendance
- number of bespoke sessions by month sorted by fiscal year (in this case starting in April) to identify any trends
- rating of the sessions based on 3 specific questions asked
